# Chatroom
Final project from Computer Networks, a chatroom

This was the final project for Computer Networks, where we got into groups of two and made a chatroom based off everything we learned in the class. Both me and my partner worked together on the server and client side to send private and public messages. This assignment was difficult, but what got both my partner and I through it was co-programming. We corrected eachother's mistakes, and gave eachother helpful advice. We met reguraly to finish this assignment, and through your cooperation, we got a 100% on the final project. This assignment to me shows that I am able to be a helpful partner when it comes to programming, and that I am responsible enough to complete my work at certain deadlines, and help my partner do the same.
